Research Topic: The associations of socioeconomic status and depression in middle-aged and elderly people in China

The running of the code consists of three parts. 

Part 1 is for data description, which includes descriptions of variables such as depression, health, work, income, marriage, education, religion, gender, and town. The code could be used to draw pie charts, histograms, and other graphs to describe our findings.

Part 2 is for data processing, which involves importing the dataset "2018全国家庭追踪调查" (China's National Household Tracking Survey in 2018) and eventually generating the file ‘Combined Data’ containing the independent and dependent variables.

Part 3 is for regression analysis, which requires importing the file "Combined Data", and examining the associations of socioeconomic status and depression in middle-aged and elderly people in China.
