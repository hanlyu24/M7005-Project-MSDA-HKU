The running of the code consists of two parts. 

Part 1 is data processing, which involves importing the dataset "2018全国家庭追踪调查" (China's National Household Tracking Survey in 2018) and eventually generating the file ‘Combined Data’ containing the independent and dependent variables.

Part 2 is regression analysis, which requires importing the file "Combined Data", and examining the associations of socioeconomic status and depression symptoms in old adults in China.
